## About Us

Based in Ethiopia, Andalem PLC is a leading AI platforms and research company dedicated to transforming Africa’s economy through generative AI and global collaborations.

At the heart of our mission is the development of agentic AI systems that learn and act autonomously, empowering Africa’s capital markets and startup ecosystems. Our solutions are designed to support regulation in keeping pace with rapid advancements in AI, bolster compliance, and automate processes, thereby creating higher levels of actionable knowledge in African capital markets, all firmly grounded in regulatory frameworks. By harnessing advanced multi-LLM architectures and cutting-edge information retrieval tools, we distill global capital market knowledge into African contexts.

Our goal is to design novel financial instruments that further connect African capital markets to their digital economies, accelerating inclusive and sustainable progress. By tailoring these instruments to the unique needs of African markets, we also aim to effectively include rural communities and drive an inclusive digital economy forward.

By aligning technological progress with societal values, we ensure the benefits of AI reach communities across the continent.
